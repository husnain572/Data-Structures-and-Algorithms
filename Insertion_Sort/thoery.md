# Insertion Sort Algorithm  

## Definition  
Insertion Sort repeatedly takes elements from the **unsorted subarray** and inserts them into their **correct position** in the **sorted subarray**.  

## Example  
Given the array:  
`11, 8, 15, 9, 4`  

### Sorting Process:
1. `8, 11, 15, 9, 4`
2. `8, 11, 15, 9, 4`
3. `8, 9, 11, 15, 4`
4. `4, 8, 11, 15, 9`

## Time and Space Complexity  
- **Worst Case Time Complexity**: **O(n²)**  
- **Best Case Time Complexity**: **Ω(n)**  
- **Space Complexity**: **O(1)**  

## Applications of Insertion Sort  
✔ **Best suited for nearly sorted arrays** or when only a few elements are unsorted.  

## Stability  
✔ **Insertion Sort is a stable sorting algorithm**, meaning it preserves the relative order of equal elements.
