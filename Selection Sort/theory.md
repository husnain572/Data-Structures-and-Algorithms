# Selection Sort Algorithm  

Selection Sort is a sorting algorithm that repeatedly finds the minimum element from the unsorted part of the array and places it at the beginning.  

## Example  
Given the array:  
`5, 8, 4, 9, 2`  

### Sorting Steps:  
1. `2, 8, 4, 9, 5`  
2. `2, 4, 8, 9, 5`  
3. `2, 4, 5, 9, 8`  
4. `2, 4, 5, 8, 9`  

## Time & Space Complexity  
- **Time Complexity**: **O(nÂ²)**  
- **Space Complexity**: **O(1)**  

## Is Selection Sort Stable?  
Selection Sort is **not** a stable sorting algorithm.  

## Applications of Selection Sort  
- Maximum swaps in the worst case: **O(n)**
