# Stack Data Structure

A **stack** is a linear data structure that follows the **Last-In, First-Out (LIFO)** principle. Elements are added and removed from one end called the **top**.

## Key Operations

* `push(x)`: Insert element `x` on top of the stack. **Time Complexity**: O(1)
* `pop()`: Remove the top element of the stack. **Time Complexity**: O(1)
* `top()`: Retrieve the top element without removing it. **Time Complexity**: O(1)
* `empty()`: Check if the stack is empty. **Time Complexity**: O(1)

## Use Cases

* **Function call management** (call stack)
* **Expression evaluation** and **syntax parsing**
* **Backtracking algorithms** (e.g., maze solving)
* **Undo mechanisms** in applications
