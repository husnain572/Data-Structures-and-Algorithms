# Doubly Linked List in C++

## Overview

A **doubly linked list** is a more advanced data structure compared to a singly linked list. Each node contains three fields:

* `data`: stores the value.
* `next`: pointer to the next node.
* `prev`: pointer to the previous node.

### Key Advantages

* Allows traversal in both forward and backward directions.
* Enables efficient insertion and deletion at both ends (head and tail).
